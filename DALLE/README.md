DALL-E Image Generator
This project is a simple web application built using Streamlit that allows users to generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E model. Users can input a text prompt, and the app will display an AI-generated image based on that prompt.

How It Works
User Input: The user provides a prompt describing the image they want to generate.
DALL-E Integration: The application sends the prompt to OpenAI's DALL-E model, which generates an image based on the input.
Image Display: The generated image is displayed within the Streamlit app interface.

Usage
Set up your OpenAI API key:
Replace '*Your OpenAI API key*' in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the Application:
Start the Streamlit app by running the following command in your terminal:
streamlit run main.py
This will open a web interface in your browser.

Generate an Image:
Enter a description of the image you want to generate in the text input field (e.g. "A cat wearing a space helmet").
Click the "Generate Image" button to generate and display the image.

Error Handling
If there is an issue generating the image (e.g., invalid API key or server issue), an error message will be displayed in the interface.
