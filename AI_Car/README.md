# AI Car Simulation with NEAT
This project simulates an autonomous car using the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The car navigates a track, making decisions based on radar inputs, and learns through evolution to avoid obstacles and maximize its performance. The simulation runs in a Pygame environment, where multiple generations of cars are trained to optimize their movement using a NEAT neural network.

## How It Works
Car Movement: Each car uses five radars to detect the distance to the track border, feeding this data into the NEAT neural network, which outputs movement decisions.
NeuroEvolution: The NEAT algorithm evolves the neural networks controlling the cars over generations, improving their ability to navigate the track.
Fitness: Each car's fitness is determined by the distance it travels before crashing, and the reward is based on the distance traveled.

## Project Structure
main.py: The core simulation script that initializes the environment, runs the NEAT algorithm, and handles car movement.
config.txt: NEAT configuration file containing parameters for evolution (e.g., population size, mutation rates).
car.png: The car sprite used in the simulation.
map.png: The track image used for the simulation.

## How to Run
### Set Up Environment:
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. These include pygame, neat-python, os, math, and random.
### Prepare Assets:
The folder should include car.png (the car sprite) and map.png (the track).
### Run the Simulation:
From the command line, navigate to the project folder and run the script:
open terminal and type in following
python main.py
The NEAT algorithm will start evolving the cars, with the simulation running in a Pygame window.
### Controls:
Press ESC to exit the simulation.

## NEAT Configuration:
The config.txt file is used to configure NEATâ€™s parameters. You can modify this file to adjust aspects like population size, mutation rates, or fitness thresholds.
NEAT Configuration Overview
The key parameters defined in config.txt are:

#### Population Size:
pop_size = 30 defines that each generation will have 30 cars.
#### Fitness Criterion:
The evolution is guided by maximizing fitness (fitness_criterion = max), where fitness is based on the distance traveled.
#### Mutation Rates:
Connection and node mutation probabilities are set to:
conn_add_prob = 0.5 and node_add_prob = 0.2
conn_delete_prob = 0.5 and node_delete_prob = 0.2
Mutation rates for bias, weight, and activation functions are also defined to promote diversity in evolving neural networks.
#### Stagnation:
To avoid getting stuck in a local optimum, the algorithm resets after max_stagnation = 20 generations with no improvement.

### Simulation Overview
Generations: The NEAT algorithm trains over several generations (default set to 5000). Each generation consists of cars trying to navigate the track.
Car Behavior: The cars adjust their speed and angle based on radar inputs. If a car collides with the track's border, it is considered "dead," and its simulation ends.
Rewards and Fitness: Cars are rewarded based on the distance they travel before crashing. The best-performing cars are used to evolve future generations.
Pygame Interface
Display: The Pygame window will show the track, cars, and the current generation and number of still-alive cars.

### File Details
config.txt: NEAT configuration file containing the genetic algorithm settings.
